## Introduction

This project simulates a high-volume data input environment using various technologies, including a message queue, Node.js backends, and React.js for the front end. The primary goal is to publish random messages to a message queue, subscribe to those messages, filter them based on priority, and display the filtered messages in real-time on the front end using Socket.IO.

## Prerequisites

Before getting started, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/)

## Technology Stack

- **Message Queue**: Choose your preferred open-source message queue (e.g., RabbitMQ, Apache Kafka, or Redis Pub/Sub).
- **Node.js Backends**: Used for both publishing and subscribing to messages.
- **Socket.IO**: Enables real-time communication between the server and the front end.
- **React.js**: The front end framework for displaying the filtered messages.

## Installation

To set up and run the simulation, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clonehttps://github.com/arjunsubedi360/zeegal-task.git
   ```

2. Change into the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd high-volume-data-simulation
   ```

3. Install the project dependencies for both the backend and frontend:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Set up your chosen message queue system (e.g., RabbitMQ, Kafka, or Redis). Ensure that the Node.js backend is configured to connect to it.

## Architecture and Design

The project architecture consists of the following components:

- **Publisher**: A Node.js backend that generates and publishes random messages to the message queue.
- **Subscriber**: Another Node.js backend that subscribes to the message queue, filters messages with a priority of 7 or higher, and sends them to the front end via Socket.IO.
- **Frontend**: A React.js application that receives and displays filtered messages in real-time.
- **Dockerization**: Dockerfiles and docker-compose files are provided to containerize the server components.

## Usage

1. Start the publisher and subscriber Node.js backends:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. Access the front end by opening a web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.

3. You will see real-time messages displayed on the front end that meet the priority criteria (priority >= 7).

## Dockerization

Dockerize the server components using the provided Dockerfile or docker-compose file. Ensure that the necessary dependencies and configurations are included in the Docker image.

## TODOs

- Implement error handling and logging for better stability.
- Add unit tests to ensure code reliability.
- Enhance the front end with additional features and styling.
- Provide detailed documentation for configuring different message queue options.

Feel free to contribute to this project by addressing the TODOs or improving any other aspect of the simulation. We welcome your feedback and contributions.
